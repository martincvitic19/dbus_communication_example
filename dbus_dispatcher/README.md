# DBUS DISPATCHER
The goal of this repository is to implement a client-server communication by utilizing the ```sdbus-cpp library```.

## BUILDING THE CODE
To build the code, create a ```build``` folder at the root level of the project and navigate to it. Then, run ```cmake ..``` to generate the build system and then ```cmake --build .``` to actually compile and link the obbject files and libraries to the executable.

To run the applications, run ```./DbusClient``` and ```./DbusClient``` from the ```build``` folder respectively.
